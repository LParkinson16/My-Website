<h1>Scrum</h1>
<p>
Scrum is a way of implementing Agile into larger teams: Viewed as a form of project management framework that Utilizes the agile methodology, it is characterised  through experiences, self-organization and reflection on successes as well as learning from losses in order to continuously improve. Whilst popular with software development teams scrum has near endless applications under most circumstances. Below I will detail the steps that comprise a scrum 
</p>

<h1>Sprint</h1>
<p>
A sprint is the process of breaking down long term targets and larger goals into smaller more short term ‘iterations’ that will contribute to the overall end goal. Sprints can make workloads much more manageable and flexible as dedicating specific teams to working on a small goal that can be reviewed and improved allows them to ship better quality work.
There are some clear associations between both agile and scrum methodologies; scrums embody the Agile value of delivering work frequently as well as responding to change as opposed to simply following a rigid plan. Many of the Scrum components compliment the Agile methods. During a sprint the development team will check in their progress during the daily standup which allows them to identify and challenges that the team may be currently facing. Proceeding this the sprint will undergo a sprint review wherein the development team will showcase work to stakeholders and other teammates to ensure it is ready for production. 
</p>

<h1>print planning</h1>
<p>
Sprint planning is a collaborative event that kicks off a sprint where the team answers two basic questions: What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?
This helps the team focus on execution, avoid unforeseen challenges and surprises and produce higher quality work. These should normally take no longer than an hour a week.
Choosing work items for the sprint is a task completed by the product owner, scrum master and development team. The product owner will also discuss an objective / agenda for the sprint that will help in achieving the sprint goal. Proceeding this the team will then create a plan for the backlog items and do their best to complete them within the allotted sprint time. By the end of the planning the team is ready to start work on the items identified in the backlog, marking their progress as “In progress” or ”done”. Planning is characterised by these steps- </p>
<list>
<li>What: The product owner sets the agenda for the sprint as well as identifying backlog items that contribute to its success. The team then decides what can be done during the sprint to make that happen</li>
<li>How: The development team will then plan what work is integral enough in order to meet the sprint goal. The resulting plan is then a negotiation between the development team and the product owner.</li>
<li>Who: The product owner will then identify a goal and the team will then determine whether they may reach that goal. Not having a product owner or team makes this process impossible</li>
<li>Inputs: Product backlogs are a good place to start planning sprints as they provide a list of things that may be of importance in the coming sprint</li>
<li>Outputs:The goal that the team describes and how they will work toward it. This is given shape by the sprint backlogs.</li>
</list>

<h1>Daily ceremonies</h1>
<p>Meetings are a more important part of Agile development and just one of many ways in which a scrum is effectively delivered. Below I will detail each of the agile ceremonies:<p>

<h2>Sprint planning</h2> 
Attendees: Development team, scrum master, product owner
Usually lasts about an hour a week, kicks off with a two hour meeting
Agile Framework: Scrum
Purpose: Sprint planning sets the team up for a successful run throughout the process of the sprint. The product owner will have prioritized a product backlog, they will then discuss items with the team and estimate workloads through a forecast. This is finalised in a review with stakeholders.

<h2>Daily stand-up</h2>
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner
When: Once per day, typically in the morning.
Duration: No more than 15 minutes.
Agile framework: Scrum/Kanban
Purpose: Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. Involved team members will answer questions such as what have you completed and what is blocking you

<h2>Iteration reviews</h2> 
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner, stakeholders(optional)
When: End of the sprint
Duration: 30-60 minutes
Agile framework: Scrum/Kanban
Purpose: Gives time to showcase the completed work at the end of a sprint. Work presented here should be fully demonstrable and be shared with stakeholders so as to review progress.

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner
When: At the end of an iteration.
Duration:  60 minutes.
Agile Framework: scrum and Kanban
Purpose: Allowing the team to understand what worked effectively throughout the sprint and what has not, giving them a chance to find solutions and adapt their approach through continuous improvement, as is the nature of the agile development.

<h1>Backlog</h1>
Backlogs are simply prioritized lists of work for development teams. The most pressing items in need of the most attention are detailed at the top of the backlog telling the team what should be tended to first. The team will pull work from the backlog in order of how capable they are of dealing with it with the members of the team involved. This is done either continuously (Kanban) or through iterative means (Scrum)
A teams roadmap and Requirements determine the future for product backlogs. Roadmaps will be broken down into multiple epics which will contain varying requirements for different components of the website. For example if building a website is the fast requirement on a website then this will be broken down into multiple epics. The product owner will then organize each of the user stories into a list for the development team or they  may choose to focus instead on specific aspects of the website i.e testing. 
Product owners may base their decisions to focus their efforts based on some of the following examples:
<list>
<li>Customer priority</li>
<li>Urgency of getting feedback</li>
<li>Relative implementation difficulty</li>
<li>Symbiotic relationships between work items (e.g. B is easier if we do A first)</li>
</list>
<p>
Once a backlog has been constructed it is important to keep up to date with it by reviewing it before moving onto other iterations to ensure priorities are in place and that feedback has been used. Regular review of backlogs are called “Backlog grooming”
</p>
<br>

<h1>Retrospective</h1>
A retrospective is anytime your team reflects on the past to improve the future. Between technical and non-technical teams, you can retro on just about anything! Right now, we're hosting a public retrospective on agile software development. Help define the future of agile by adding some of your ideas to our board. 

<h1>Scrum master</h1>
<p>Like project managers; scrum masters lead however they do so by promoting scrum methodologies. Scrum masters are. tasked with promoting, informing and supporting team members throughout sprints. This is done by helping members understand scrum theories,practices, rules as well as values. Below I have listed some of the scrum masters responsibilities:</p>
<list>
<li>Stand-ups</li>
<li>Sprint iteration meetings</li>
<li>Sprint reviews</li>
<li>Retrospectives</li>
<li>Board admin</li>
<li>One on ones</li>
<li>Internal consulting </li>
<li>Reporting </li>
<li>Blockers</li>
<li>Busy work</li>
</list>

<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>In scrums there are three main roles:</p>
<list>
<li>The development team: The core laborers of the project, tasked with actually completing the work. The development team isn't always composed of programmers. Responsibilities for the development team include:
Delivering work through the sprint
Making sure their work is transparent at the daily standups as these meetings are a place where their work can be reviewed as well as seeking help from other developers.</li>
<br>
<li>Product owners : It is the responsibility of the product owners to ensure that the development team is producing sufficient work so as to meet sprints. The product owner should have a clear idea of the customer as well as the vision of the scrum team’s end goal. Product owners will also factor in the needs of the stakeholder into the workflow. Agile/Scrum teams are designed to be dynamic meaning that if there is a change in priorities then this may unbalance the teams focus as it may demand complete restructuring of the team and what each person is doing. Due to this it is best to have one person decide the organisation of the team being the product owners.
  <list>
<ol>Managing scrum backlog</ol>
<ol>Release management</ol> 
<ol>Stakeholder management</ol>
<list>
</li>
<br>
<li>
The scrum master is the role responsible for gluing everything together and ensuring that scrum is being done well. that means they help the product owner define value, the development team deliver said value, and the scrum team improve. The scrum master will focus on:
Transparency: ensuring that the scrum team works in a transparent way. Examples include creating story maps and updating confluence pages with the retrospective ideas.
Empiricism: This is the idea that the best way of planning is to do work and learn from the mistakes committed to on previous iterations. This is the process of learning from mistakes
Self organisation: self organization comes over time and requires help and support. The scrum master will encourage team members to step outside their comfort zone by trying different things and practices.
Values: scrum defines 5 values of courage, focus, commitment, respect, and openness not because they are nice to have, but because they create an environment of physiological safety and trust.
</li>
