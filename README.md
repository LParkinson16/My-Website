# An introduction to the Agile/Scrum methodology 

## what is agile?

The Agile workflow is a means of more efficiently working. Utilizing said workflow allows for a more efficient and flexible way of committing to project management tasks.
Agile was created as an answer to the waterfall method of doing tasks which cannot be used to apply to all circumstances. Instead Agile is a process of perpetual improvement receiving feedback and incorporating maintenance.

The Agile manifesto is as follows: “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation responding to change over following a plan. That is while there is value in the items on the right, we value the left”


## scrum
Scrum is a way of implementing Agile into larger teams: Viewed as a form of project management framework that Utilizes the agile methodology, it is characterised  through experiences, self-organization and reflection on successes as well as learning from losses in order to continuously improve. Whilst popular with software development teams scrum has near endless applications under most circumstances. Below I will detail the steps that comprise a scrum

## sprint 
A sprint is the process of breaking down long term targets and larger goals into smaller more short term ‘iterations’ that will contribute to the overall end goal. Sprints can make workloads much more manageable and flexible as dedicating specific teams to working on a small goal that can be reviewed and improved allows them to ship better quality work.
There are some clear associations between both agile and scrum methodologies; scrums embody the Agile value of delivering work frequently as well as responding to change as opposed to simply following a rigid plan. Many of the Scrum components compliment the Agile methods. During a sprint the development team will check in their progress during the daily standup which allows them to identify and challenges that the team may be currently facing. Proceeding this the sprint will undergo a sprint review wherein the development team will showcase work to stakeholders and other teammates to ensure it is ready for production.

## Sprint planning
Sprint planning is a collaborative event that kicks off a sprint where the team answers two basic questions: What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?
This helps the team focus on execution, avoid unforeseen challenges and surprises and produce higher quality work. These should normally take no longer than an hour a week.
Choosing work items for the sprint is a task completed by the product owner, scrum master and development team. The product owner will also discuss an objective / agenda for the sprint that will help in achieving the sprint goal. Proceeding this the team will then create a plan for the backlog items and do their best to complete them within the allotted sprint time. By the end of the planning the team is ready to start work on the items identified in the backlog, marking their progress as “In progress” or ”done”. Planning is characterised by these steps

What: The product owner sets the agenda for the sprint as well as identifying backlog items that contribute to its success. The team then decides what can be done during the sprint to make that happen

How: The development team will then plan what work is integral enough in order to meet the sprint goal. The resulting plan is then a negotiation between the development team and the product owner.

Who: The product owner will then identify a goal and the team will then determine whether they may reach that goal. Not having a product owner or team makes this process impossible 

Inputs: Product backlogs are a good place to start planning sprints as they provide a list of things that may be of importance in the coming sprint 

Outputs:The goal that the team describes and how they will work toward it. This is given shape by the sprint backlogs.

## Daily ceremonies
Meetings are a more important part of Agile development and just one of many ways in which a scrum is effectively delivered. Below I will detail each of the agile ceremonies:

Sprint planning 
Attendees: Development team, scrum master, product owner
Usually lasts about an hour a week, kicks off with a two hour meeting
Agile Framework: Scrum
Purpose: Sprint planning sets the team up for a successful run throughout the process of the sprint. The product owner will have prioritized a product backlog, they will then discuss items with the team and estimate workloads through a forecast. This is finalised in a review with stakeholders.

Daily stand-up
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner
When: Once per day, typically in the morning.
Duration: No more than 15 minutes.
Agile framework: Scrum/Kanban
Purpose: Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. Involved team members will answer questions such as what have you completed and what is blocking you

Iteration reviews 
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner, stakeholders(optional)
When: End of the sprint
Duration: 30-60 minutes
Agile framework: Scrum/Kanban
Purpose: Gives time to showcase the completed work at the end of a sprint. Work presented here should be fully demonstrable and be shared with stakeholders so as to review progress.

Retrospective
Attendees: development team, scrum master, product owner
When: At the end of an iteration.
Duration:  60 minutes.
Agile Framework: scrum and Kanban
Purpose: Allowing the team to understand what worked effectively throughout the sprint and what has not, giving them a chance to find solutions and adapt their approach through continuous improvement, as is the nature of the agile development


## Backlog
Backlogs are simply prioritized lists of work for development teams. The most pressing items in need of the most attention are detailed at the top of the backlog telling the team what should be tended to first. The team will pull work from the backlog in order of how capable they are of dealing with it with the members of the team involved. This is done either continuously (Kanban) or through iterative means (Scrum)
A teams roadmap and Requirements determine the future for product backlogs. Roadmaps will be broken down into multiple epics which will contain varying requirements for different components of the website. For example if building a website is the fast requirement on a website then this will be broken down into multiple epics. The product owner will then organize each of the user stories into a list for the development team or they  may choose to focus instead on specific aspects of the website i.e testing. 
Product owners may base their decisions to focus their efforts based on some of the following examples:
Customer priority
Urgency of getting feedback
Relative implementation difficulty
Symbiotic relationships between work items (e.g. B is easier if we do A first)
Once a backlog has been constructed it is important to keep up to date with it by reviewing it before moving onto other iterations to ensure priorities are in place and that feedback has been used. Regular review of backlogs are called “Backlog grooming”


## Retrospective
A retrospective is anytime your team reflects on the past to improve the future. Between technical and non-technical teams, you can retro on just about anything! Right now, we're hosting a public retrospective on agile software development. Help define the future of agile by adding some of your ideas to our board.

## Scrum master
Like project managers; scrum masters lead however they do so by promoting scrum methodologies. Scrum masters are. tasked with promoting, informing and supporting team members throughout sprints. This is done by helping members understand scrum theories,practices, rules as well as values. Below I have listed some of the scrum masters responsibilities:
Stand-ups
Sprint iteration meetings
Sprint reviews
Retrospectives
Board admin
One on ones
Internal consulting 
Reporting 
Blockers


## Roles
In scrums there are three main roles:
